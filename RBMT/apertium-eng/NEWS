### 2016, November

+ Lexicon from dying apertium-en-fr mostly merged in:
  + single-token adjectives
  + single-token adverbs
  + single-token proper nouns
  + single-token common nouns (~500 remain)
  + single-token verbs
  - NOTE: closed class words not added. hopefully they already exist in apertium-eng
  - TODO: phrases with adj/adv/np/n/vblex not added
+ Tagger description file *.tsx was copied from apertium-en-fr w/o adaptation.
