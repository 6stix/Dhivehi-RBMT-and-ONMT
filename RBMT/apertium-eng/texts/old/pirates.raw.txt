After a failed attempt to rescue his first mate , Joshamee Gibbs ( Kevin McNally ) in London , Captain Jack Sparrow ( Johnny Depp ) is brought before King George II ( Richard Griffiths ) , who wants Jack to guide an expedition to the Fountain of Youth before the Spanish locate it . 
Heading the expedition is Jack 's old nemesis , Captain Hector Barbossa ( Geoffrey Rush ) , now a privateer in service to the Royal Navy after losing his leg and ship , the Black Pearl . 
Jack escapes , but his father , Captain Teague ( Keith Richards ) , finds him and warns Jack about the Fountain 's tests . 
He also reveals that someone is impersonating Jack . 
The impostor is Angelica ( Penélope Cruz ) , Jack 's former lover and the daughter of the ruthless pirate Blackbeard ( Ian McShane ) , who practices voodoo magic and wields a magical sword that controls his ship . 
Jack is taken aboard Blackbeard 's ship , the Queen Anne 's Revenge , and forced to lead the way to the Fountain and find two silver chalices that once belonged to Juan Ponce de León , both believed to be aboard his lost ship . 
The Fountain 's water must be drunk simultaneously from the two chalices . 
The person drinking from the chalice containing a mermaid 's tear has their life extended , while the other person dies , their life drained from their body and their remaining years ' donated ' to the other . 
Meanwhile , Gibbs narrowly escapes execution by memorizing and destroying Jack 's map , forcing Barbossa to spare him so he could navigate to the Fountain . 
Blackbeard seeks the Fountain 's power to circumvent his predestined fatal encounter with " a one-legged man , " ( Barbossa ) and sets a course for Whitecap Bay .
