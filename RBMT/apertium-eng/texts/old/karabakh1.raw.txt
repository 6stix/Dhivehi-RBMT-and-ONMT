During the Soviet period , many Armenians and Azeris lived together peacefully .
However , when Mikhail Gorbachev introduced the policies of Glasnost and Perestroika , the majority Armenians from the autonomous area of Nagorno-Karabakh in the Azerbaijan SSR began a movement to unify with the Armenian SSR .
In 1988 , the Armenians of Karabakh voted to secede and join Armenia .
This , along with Armenian massacres and pogroms in Azerbaijan resulted in the conflict that became known as the Nagorno-Karabakh War .
The violence resulted in de facto Armenian control of Nagorno-Karabakh and some surrounding areas which was effectively halted when both sides agrees to observe a cease-fire which has been in effect since May 1994 , and in late 1995 both also agreed to OSCE field gis of the Minsk Group of the OSCE .
The Minsk Group is currently co-chaired by the U.S. , France , and Russia and comprises Armenia , Azerbaijan , Turkey , and several Western European nations .
Despite this cease-fire , upwards of 40 clashes are reported along the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict lines of control each year .
Since 1997 , the Minsk Group Co-Chairs have presented three proposals to serve as a framework for resolving the conflict .
One side or the other rejected each of those proposals .
Beginning in 1999 , the Presidents of Azerbaijan and Armenia initiated a direct dialogue through a series of face-to-face meetings , often facilitated by the Minsk Group Co-Chairs .
Most recently the OSCE sponsored a round of negotiations between the Presidents in Key West , Florida .
U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell launched the talks on the 3rd April , 2001 , and the negotiations continued with mediation by the U.S. , Russia , and France until the 6th April , 2001 .
The Co-Chairs are continuing to work with the two Presidents in the hope of finding a lasting peace .
