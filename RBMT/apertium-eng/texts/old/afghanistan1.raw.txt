Politics in Afghanistan has historically consisted of power struggles , bloody coups and unstable transfers of power . 
With the exception of a military junta , the country has been governed by nearly every system of government over the past century , including a monarchy , republic , theocracy and communist state . 
The constitution ratified by the 2003 Loya jirga restructured the government as an Islamic republic consisting of three branches , executive , legislative and judicial . 
Afghanistan is currently led by President Hamid Karzai , who was elected in October 2004 . 
The current parliament was elected in 2005 . 
Among the elected officials were former mujahadeen , Taliban members , communists , reformists , and Islamic fundamentalists . 
28% of the delegates elected were women , three points more than the 25% minimum guaranteed under the constitution . 
This made Afghanistan , long known under the Taliban for its oppression of women , one of the leading countries in terms of female representation . 
Construction for a new parliament building began on the 29th August , 2005 . 
Although literacy levels are very low , classic Persian poetry plays a very important role in the Afghan culture . 
Persian culture has , and continues to , exert a great influence over Afghan culture . 
Poetry has always been one of the major educational pillars in Iran and Afghanistan , to the level that it has integrated itself into culture . 
Almost every homeowner owns one or more poetry collections of some sort , even if they are not read often . 
Many of the famous Persian poets of the tenth to fifteenth centuries stem from Khorasan where is now known as Afghanistan . 
They were mostly also scholars in many disciplines like languages , natural sciences , medicine , religion and astronomy . 
In addition to poets and authors , numerous Persian scientists were born or worked in the region of present-day Afghanistan .
